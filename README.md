# What should I tweet?

The timeless question. This app uses [jakeboxer/two_chainz](https://github.com/jakeboxer/two_chainz) to look up your tweets and figure out the answer.

# Installation instructions

I dunno why you'd wanna run this locally or rehost it, but whatever.

You gotta set 4 environment variables:

- `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`
- `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`
- `TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN`
- `TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`

Those should be self-explanatory, but if they're not, check out [the "Configuration" section of sferik/twitter](https://github.com/sferik/twitter#configuration).
